## Maps

**Map 1:** Static world map showing the arc of the two flights from SÃ£o Paulo to Beijing, with a stop in Adis Ababba. Possibly putting geompoints on the cities in China that we visited.
<br>
Tools: QGIS + Ilustrator
<br><br>
**Map 2:** Interactive map where people can navigate to see details of spending per city
<br>
Tools: geojson.io + Mapbox
<br><br>

## Graphs

**Graph 1:** Streamflow OR heatmap showing the volume of expenses by category over a timeline of days
<br><br>
**Graph 2:** A ranking table of the most expensive cities in each category.
<br><br>
**Graph 3:** Curiosity charts, like a word cloud showing the things we bought the most, the place we spent more money shopping, comparing the price of water and coffee in different places etc.
